# Skin Analytics - Frond End Technical Exercise

## Guidelines

Thanks again for your time during the first round interview. In order to assess your technical level, please find below a technical test which include a small coding exercise and some general background questions. 

## General background questions

- One client is reporting an issue on your main web application you cannot replicate. How do you proceed to narrow down the problem?
- Tell me about one thing that many web sites do poorly. How would you fix it?

# Coding exercise

Below is a small coding challenge to complete at home. You can use as much online resources (Google, online documentation, etc.) as you wish. We expect you to spend no more than 1-2 hours on it. We don't want you to over-engineer the solution but be prepared to extend the functionnality in the next step of the interview process. Finally, we ask you to submit a solution that you'd be happy to go live with and works "out of the box‚Äù.
