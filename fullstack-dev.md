# Skin Analytics - Full Stack Developer Exercise

Thanks again for your time during the first round interview. In order to assess your technical level, please find below a technical test which include a small coding exercise and some general background questions. 

## General background questions

- One client is reporting an issue on your main web application you cannot replicate. How do you proceed to narrow down the problem?
- Tell me about one thing that many web sites do poorly. How would you fix it?

## Coding exercise

Below is a small coding challenge to complete at home. You can use as much online resources (Google, online documentation, etc.) as you wish. We expect you to spend no more than 3 hours on it. If you can't finish, please submit whatever you have, as unfinished code is still better than no code. 

We don't want you to over-engineer the solution but be prepared to extend the functionnality in the next step of the interview process. Finally, we ask you to submit a solution that you'd be happy to go live with and works "out of the box‚Äù.

Please create a local git repository (or clone this one) and then commit to this as you work. When you have finished please zip up the whole folder (including the .git folder) and email it to recruitment@skinanalytics.co.uk. *Please do not make your solution public*.

Please include any setup instructions and keep the setup steps simple. Your solution should be working on latest versions of Firefox and Chrome. Don't worry about any browser inconsistencies.


### Guidelines technical specifications

We are asking you to build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.

Running the app, we should be able to see the latest **UK news**. Clicking on a news item will bring the user to an individual article page which should also include the thumbail (the *urlToImage* field).
Bonus point: Give the ability to the user to filter news by keywords (see [everything endpoint api](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything))

Given the fact that this is a Full Stack developer position, we are expecting a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

### What we are looking for
- We anticipate that this app may have future requirements, so you should aim for maintainability with your solution.
- The javascript ecosystem changes quickly, so we like to see knowledge of javascript fundamentals.
- We want to discover how you writecode day-to-day.
- We don't want you to spend hours tweaking every pixel. Keep it simple and functional.
